# Replication Data for Clinton, Eubank, Fresh, and Shepherd's "Polling Place Changes and Political Participation: Evidence from North Carolina Presidential Elections, 2008-2016"

A few notes about working with this repository:

- Files called `.keep` are just placeholders for folders. They can be ignored.
- Use of this repository will require installation of [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for managing large files. If you attempt to clone this repository and DON'T have git lfs installed, data files will just be small text files with a random appearing number.
- To replicate:
    - Open `set_globals.do` and change the global `nc_electioneering` to the path to wherever you have saved this repository. Then choose whether to set the global `sample_size` to `10percent` or `full`. This code takes *forever* to run, so we recommend testing things against the 10percent sample before moving to running against the full sample. Paper results obviously are generated with the full sample.
    - Run `MASTER_RUN_ALL_FILES.do`.
    - All results (save some files prefixed `Map_` we made by hand for illustrative figures) will be re-created in `50_results_full`, and if you build the paper in `30_docs`, it will pull all those results into the paper and rebuild the PDF. 
- Note that this was most recently run in StataMP 16, and had helper functions detailed below installed.
- All files are meaning to be run in the ordinal sequence implied by their prefix number. However, these are far from ordinal (over time, we've added and removed files, so weird gaps exist. For more on this style of workflow management, [please see here](https://www.practicaldatascience.org/html/workflow.html).)
- Compiling `30_docs/polling_place_paper/CEFS_PSRM_PPChangeAndParticipation.tex` will automatically pull in all results generated while running.
