     - Note: for Wayback Machine archives of "Current" North Carolina Polling location data, use the form "https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vt.ncsbe.gov/PPLkup/PollingPlaceResult/?CountyID=#&PollingPlaceID=#, where the two red, emboldened "#"s are replaced with numbers. The county's numbers go in alphabetical order (e.g., Alamance's county number in the URL is 1), but within each county, the polling locations' HTML/URL numbers vary widely in distribution and
     "randomness."
